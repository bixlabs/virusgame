# Overview

<br>
<p>Virus is a single player game project based on the classic Laberynth 3D game with the plus that players can learn about the body and have fun at the same time. </p>
<br>

# Concept

<br>
<p>The game came out of thinking about fun ways to show how the body system works and make the information more accesible for the ones who doesn´t really understand yet or just don´t know much baout it. </p>
<br>

# Story

<br>
<p>You are a virus that enters the body system and starts travelling around the body. Each screen will show different organs where you will have to collect as much antybodies as possible. But the system will try to deffend itself attacking it and making the field more and more difficult.  </p>

# Gameplay

<br>
<p>Using the phone or tablet as the controller the player will have to move it in different directions to make the virus move around the field and take from the start point to the other side of the screen dodging different obstacles that will kill when touched and make you start all over again.<br>The core mechanic is simple and intuitive, and have an easy learning curve, introducing more advanced mechanics little by little. </p>
<br>

# Physics

<br>
<p>We will have to dodge different obstacles that will influene our character some how. We ill find fat stuck on the walls that will reduce our speed and glue us a little while others will make us bounce to make our path more difficult. </p>
