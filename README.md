# 1. Overview

<br>
<p>Virus is a single player game project based on the classic Laberynth 3D game with the plus that players can learn about the body and have fun at the same time. </p>
<br>

# 2. Concept

<br>
<p>The game came out of thinking about fun ways to show how the body system works and make the information more accessible for the ones who doesn´t really understand yet or just don´t know much about it. </p>
<br>

# 3. Storyline

<br>
<p>You are a virus that enters the body system and starts travelling around the body. Each screen will show different organs where you will have to collect as much antibodies as possible. But the system will try to defend itself attacking it and making the field more and more difficult.  </p>

# 4. Game structure

<br>
<p>It will have three levels; easy, medium and hard, the difficulty will be given by the presence of more fat and the complexity of the field. Before each game you will have a short story about specific health issues.</p>
<br>

# 5. Gameplay

<br>
<p>Using the phone or tablet as the controller the player will have to move it in different directions to make the virus move around the field and take from the start point to the other side of the screen dodging different obstacles that will kill when touched and make you start all over again.<br>The core mechanic is simple and intuitive, and have an easy learning curve, introducing more advanced mechanics little by little. </p>
<br>

# 6. Bonus

<br>
<p>As bonus screens we will use different situations in a body that will make the game a lot more fun. For example you can find the "In love" bonus or the "Stomach ache" bonus screen that will make you laugh and enjoy the game.</p>
<br>

# 7. Powerups

<br>
<p>To increase the fun we included powerups that will differ from each other with different colors. But be careful cause they can harm you instead so you have to find the way to dodge them.</p>
<br>

# 8. Physics

<br>
<p>We will have to dodge different obstacles that will influence our character some how. We ill find fat stuck on the walls that will reduce our speed and glue us a little while others will make us bounce to make our path more difficult. </p>
<br>

# 9. Music and sound

<br>
<p>There is no music added to this level.</p>
